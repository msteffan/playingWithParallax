# Ideas

This Star Wars-inspired web app will allow users to log in and create a character, including a generated avatar name and profession. Then, users can explore the Star Wars universe using a map of planets. Clicking on a planet will cause the user to travel to that particular planet, where he/she will learn about the planet's geography, residents, climates, etc. After clicking 3 dropdowns, the user will receive a "token" from the planetâ€”which will be saved to the user's profile.

The user can view his/her profile page at any time and see which tokens have been collected. If the user wants to trade tokens, he/she can go to the "marketplace" and post a token for trade. Other users can then trade their tokens and interact.
